Survive the Fish Tank is a game that I developed in June of 2018. At that time I wanted to make something for my phone to pass the time and see how mobile development compares to desktop. In the begining I didn't know anything about mobile development. So,I enrolled in a Udemy course on programming in Unity. By the end of the course I made 3 tutorial apps and then decided to make an orginal game.

After brain storming many ideas for hours, the sea theme stood out the most. This was happening during the time that water polution was begining to be taken more seriously and I felt there weren't that many phone games where the player is underwater. The sketches were imported into photoshop and made into sprites that could be imported into Unity.

The aim of the game is to bounce from side to side whilst trying to avoid mines being dropped in the Ocean. Bellow you can be see a demonstration of me failing miserably at it.
