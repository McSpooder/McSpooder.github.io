5. Developed in C#

## Summary
In year 2 of the Undergraduate Degree, we were tasked to develop an application that would benefit current and prospective university students. The requirement was to work and collaborate on a single piece of code whilst using Agile management techniques and source control to stay on track with deliverables. 

We all shared the same idea that the university lacked any widely accessible and easy to use module information resources. Also, there wasn't a platform where students could review and rate modules. With this in mind, the HUMP was birthed. That is the Hull University Module Picker... 

Scrumban was the Agile Methedology employed. We split the development into sprints where each Tuesday we would meet up and create 'user stories' which were essentially requirements. After prioratising and assigning the stories would go off and develop them in pairs. One person would code whilst the other would watch until swapping. We found this to be very effective during the infancy of the project.

A video demonstrating the finished products can be found below.
