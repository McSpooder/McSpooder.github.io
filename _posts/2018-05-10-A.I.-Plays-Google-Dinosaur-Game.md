You know that feeling when you turn on your computer, just to immediately double click on chrome as soon as the desktop loads, in hopes of getting that good old dopamine release from watching random cat videos on you tube? We all know sometimes this doesn't go as planed, like when you get hit with the notorious "There is no internet" message.

The dinosaur next to it makes everything better. It reminds you that you could have been a caveman yourself without even a computer or an internet connection to complain about. Or if you're a pessimist you might think google is laughing at you by likening your computer to a pre-historic mammal that probably got killed by a rock hitting the earth a long time ago.

Either way the screen is not the end because if you press the space bar the screen turns into a game where you are a dinosaur trying to overcome everything that the 8 bit world is throwing at you. Its a simple side scroller where you have to jump or duck to not get hit by the obstacles that you are running towards.

If you didn't already know you could do that, I probably have blown your mind but save some mind to be blown for this story. A youtuber by the name of "Code Bullet" has managed to train a deep neural net to play the game indefinitely. The most amazing part is that he trained it using a genetic algorithm which consisted of creating multiple agents in the game world and having them compete against each other in hopes of spreading their mutations to the next generation of agents. Sounds familiar if you ask me. Ahem Darwanism. The outcome is amazing, you can see the full video here:
