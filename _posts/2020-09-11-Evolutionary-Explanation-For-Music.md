People evolved to seek out patterns in the auditory medium. That's because it is the only effective way to communicate in the world. I.e. via sound using your voice. Therefore people that were born with this reward circuit configuration could assimilate together more effectively and then pass on their genes. Now this reward circuit is being hijacked by music, hence giving it the illusion of sounding good. It explains why music with lyrics sounds better to most people, even though most of the time the lyrics are unrelatable or even unintelligible.
