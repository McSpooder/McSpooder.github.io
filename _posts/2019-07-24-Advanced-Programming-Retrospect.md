This is a retrospect for the advanced programming module from semester 2 of year 2 of my undergraduate. 

Marks:

| Examination   | Mark          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Test 1        | 78            |
| Test 2        | 100           |
| Coursework    | 50            |


The exams were easy because of the preparation that went into them. Most of the lectures were attended and attempts at class revision notes have been made. Most important revision tool used was of course Anki. I've made revision cards for most of the lectures a month or two before the exam and went full throttle at committing them to memory. It became part of my morning routine to wake up and review the revision cards. Something that wasn't as helpful was the reading list book. 

The effective c++ programming book, although was insightful to read before the lectures, took too long to dissect and comprehend to make it viable. There were times where I would spend hours trying to comprehend a chapter which would eventually devolve into procrastination. This was waste full and a better approach would be to get more brain cells. Just kidding. The book mostly focused on intermediate c++ programmers whilst I was still new to the language. It would've been better to strengthen my c++ foundation before diving into such a technical piece of work.

The coursework was an undeniable anchor to my mark yet so much time and effort was put into it. I'd say 20% of the effort got me 60% of my mark. The rest of the effort was wasted on optimization. The efficiency marks were hinged upon the algorithm and the data structures. So I spent a lot of the time worrying about how to make my algorithms more efficient overlooking the fact that they were wrong. Most notably, the findshortestroute algorithm; the specification didn't meant find the shortest route in terms of physical distance across the edges but shortest distance in terms of number of edges traversed.

If this was done the first time I would've seen a sizable difference in my grade. Also talking to the lecturers rather than assuming would've been a good idea.

The subsequent hit to the ACW mark was from insufficient testing. When I finished the coursework, I calculated the mark that I would've gotten if I got all the algorithms correct not paying head to the idea that they may even be wrong. When I was coding the program the results that I got were slightly different to the ones showcased in the spec but I surmised it was due to an arbitrary unit conversion. This assumption wasn't completely heinous but it lead to me ignoring the few test data that the spec provided. Have I tested my algorithms properly I would've clocked on to the fact that the 3 main ones were wrong and could've spent time fixing them rather than optimizing. Next time take testing seriously and adopt test driven development if there's any test data provided. 

In conclusion, the overall mark could've been improved by easing myself into the technical work and by making some simple unit tests. Reading the specification properly would also have helped. Although the mark was disappointing its still decent and puts me on target to achieving a 1st by the end of year 3.
