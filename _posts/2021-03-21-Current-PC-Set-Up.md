Dopksi is the name of my computer that I was gifted around 2013, give or take. It is a prebuilt rig from Asus and for the first time it had a graphics card that made it possible for me to play games above 30fps. Since then it has gone through a series of upgrades where it is now almost an entirely different computer was it not for the hard drives. Bellow you can find the current specs and an Amazon link if you wish to purchase a similar set up.

Case: Corsair
PSU: Corsair CX750M
Motherboard: Gigabyte B460M DS3H (mATX)
CPU: core i7-10700 (10th gen)
Ram: x2 8gb Corsair DDR4 (Vengeance)
GFX: Nvidia 1070ti (MSI)
Drive: Sandisk SSD 400+ gb

Some other drives are a WD hdd and another smaller ssd. Also, I realize the PSU is a bit overkill but its nice to future proof the rig.
