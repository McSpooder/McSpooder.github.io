This blog will serve as a space for me to talk about my interests which are in the intersection of software engineering, machine learning and web technologies. Also, you can expect to find my personal retrospectives on life and work if you are feeling nosy. 

If you are recruiting, I will be available to start working from June which is when I will finish my computer science undergraduate. To see some of my past projects and software you can click on the portfolio tab.
